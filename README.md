# Restaurant Reviews Project
> Final project for Udacity Front End Nanodegree program

## What is it?
> The restaurant reviews app is an application which presents some locally stored restaurant location, detail, and review data in a mock website. It consists of two pages. A main page which shows a map with restaurant locations and several tiles with additional information for each restaurant. Each restaurant has a detail link which leads to a detail page for that specific restaurant.

## Installation
> This app requires npm to get started. Several, mostly developmental, dependencies can be found in the usual npm package.json file. After running your npm install series you should have gulp installed. Gulp 4 will be required to view this website in the same development environment for which it has been tested. To be on the safe side run the command gulp rebuild first. This will rebuild the public file which houses the public facing website. Finally run gulp watch from the root folder and the site should be served on localhost:3000.

Example sequence:

* first:
```sh
npm install --save
```

* second:
```sh
gulp rebuild
```

* third:
```sh
gulp watch
```
